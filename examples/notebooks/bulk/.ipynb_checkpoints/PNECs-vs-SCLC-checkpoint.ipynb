    "PNECs are like generalists that complete many different tasks sub-optimally. If each tumor cell can specialize in a single PNEC task, overall the tumor’s “group phenotypic composition” is more fit than if each individual cell tried to do all tasks. Because these are cancer cells, they are also more plastic than normal differentiated cells and are therefore better able to trade off tasks to increase the fitness of the whole tumor when appropriate.\n",
